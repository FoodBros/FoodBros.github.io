Blah blah blogs are hard, blah blah… JUST DO IT.

!!!! SHIA LABEOUF IMAGE!!!!!

Writing about food is a complex and difficult endeavour which even the most accomplished chefs struggle with. We here at Food Bros have developed a highly sophisticated ranking system to help us determine the quality of food. You know, to apply some machine learning on that big data later...

We present to you “The Three Tenets of StreetFood”......in JSON.

{% highlight javascript %}
{
  “firewall”: “Something about being spicey, maybe, depending how we feel like”,
  “rage”: “[PARTY?!?!?!!?](https://youtu.be/KJgJx05hR4M?t=137)”,
  “[synergise](https://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/synergise#synergise__2)”:”bacon awesome, eggs awesome, BACON AND EGGS”
}
{% endhighlight %}

We all love buzzwords, but maybe they should also have some meaning. (Doesn’t that defeat buzzword? idk) Let’s go.

Let’s be honest, the only word you care about us explaining is Synergize, I mean do you even watch HBO’s Silicon Valley? As the Oxford Dictionary puts it: “The interaction or cooperation of two or more organizations, substances, or other agents to produce a combined effect greater than the sum of their separate effects”. That’s pretty chill. Is it not obvious to you why we chose it now? Read [here](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=synergy+lol) for more details.

This week we found ourselves wandering down the (in)famous Brick Lane to explore this Asian market for some peng food - it might as well have been [Zao Jun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitchen_God) kitchen because there was literally too much DOPE shit to eat!

Singaporean Rendang
{
  “firewall”: “6”,
  “rage”: “7”,
  “synergise”: “8”
}

As our [numero uno](http://www.bbc.co.uk/languages/spanish/) favourite this week, we present to you the from the exotic corners of Shoreditch’s kitchen factory’s Rendang. Having more oil than Saudi Arabia it lubed up our mouths for a quick and delicious food orgasm. Having said that, an air conditioner may have been nice as we emptied their chilli bowl into our container. Beyond exaggerating the spiciness, that chilli paste is definitely a necessity. This Singaporean Rendang perfectly synergizes mince with a bunch of other delicious stuff. So good that apparently C’s shoes even wanted some - which D was happy to offer them (if only we had a picture this would actually be funny…)

TBT - Back when we were broke as fuck ballers at the National University of Singapore, all we could afford was the (still delicious) hawker centers in S’pore, we were eating this stuff like literally every day at Mousakka - this shit riveled it… for realsies.

Myanmar “Food”
{
  “firewall”: “4”,
  “rage”: “6”,

}
Dish [numero dos](http://www.bbc.co.uk/languages/spanish/) - Myanmar food. That may sound vague, but that’s how they themselves refer to it. The amazing thing about Myanmar’s cuisine is its location on the edge of SE Asia, getting just as many culinary influences from India, its Eastern neighbour. An amazing fusion - or synergy, one might say.

The first thing we should mention here is that Daryl hates eggplant, his mum used to force feed him that shit and it was hella ratchet. Myanmar has managed to solve this problem, doing some voodoo shit and cooking it for ages, creating a delicious, tender meal - we seriously rate it. Reminiscent of an Indian tomato-based curry with other distinct SE Asian flavor-flavs (lemongrass anyone?), luckily the chicken was also delectable. Synergy again?!?! I’m not sure we even needed the chicken to enjoy this meal.

Dim Sum

knock knock
whos there
frozen
frozen who?
frozen dumplings asshole.

Dim Sum are generally always pretty chill. In the case of this place a little bit too chill, as in it was fucking cold, literally [frozen](https://i.imgur.com/fhc63SD.jpg) inside.

On a serious note, they weren’t that bad… we don’t really like writing negative shit, but the dumplings were simply put, sub par… like your mum last night.

FREE SAMPLES
Malaysian Pancakes
{

}
We were also given a sample of a Malaysian pancake with coconut and nutella. Allow me to explain - if Gabriel himself came down to bring a message from God which described the perfect mixture between sweetness, it has to have been in this Malaysian pancake. Coconut, nutella, sugar on a pancake - all molten. If I had not been at [this point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhbHTjMLN5c&feature=youtu.be&t=97) I would have gotten one.

Pretty out of this world, but considering our generally “too fucking full to eat more” feeling, no “please sir, can I have some more” for us. A repeat of this location is in order.
